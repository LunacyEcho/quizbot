"One work by this philosopher uses the metaphor of a man in a boat to illustrate the futility of trusting Schopenhauer's principium individuationis to reduce suffering.

Another book by this author of ""An Attempt at Self-Criticism"" claims that widespread literacy has caused writing to be diluted for the masses. That book describes an evolution from (*) camel to lion to child in the section ""The Three Metamorphoses of Man"".

"This thinker used the example of a detached human hand to illustrate how the soul can live on after death without existing as a separate substance inside the human body, thus rejecting the argument of the plurality of forms. John Haldane is one of the leaders of an ""analytical"" school of thought dedicated to this thinker, the study of whose work was espoused by Leo XIII's bull Aeterni Patris. One of his works may have been written at the behest of Raymond of Peñafort and is split into a discussion of human truths and divine truths. He referred to Averroes as ""The Commentator"" and Aristotle as ""The Philosopher"" in a work in which he reproduced the arguments of the first cause and the unmoved mover as two of his ""five ways"" for showing the existence of god.

"Donald Davidson's argument that there is only one thing with this property is known as the slingshot argument. The prosentential theory of this concept is similar to disquotational theories such as Frank P. Ramsey's redundancy theory. In logic, a formula is valid if and only if it has this property under any interpretation. A paper by Alfred Tarski about this concept ""in formalized languages"" introduced a deflationary theory of it. Other theories of this concept include the coherence theory and the correspondence theory. A tautology necessarily has this property, which can be computed for expressions using namesake ""tables."" For 10 points, name this property which is contrasted with falsity.","Truth"
"Rorty's Achieving Our Country extols this philosopher as embodying the American spirit of Whitman's Democratic Vistas, identifying him as the ""progressive Left"" in contrast to the ""critical Left"" of Lyotard. This man argued that the first title entity is created only in response to ""negative externalities"" in a tract describing how corporate influence and vulgar pop culture had created an ""eclipse,"" but not the ""phantom"" imagined by Walter Lippman.

He defined the real as the object represented in the truth, which is the opinion ""agreed to by all who investigate."" He called the world as interpreted by senses the phaneron, and set the triad of sign, object, and interpretant as the adicity of Thirdness, which was developed along with Secondness and Firstness in his essay ""On a New List of Categories.""

"This book's universality was attacked by Heidegger in the Davos debate, and its so-called ""principle of significance"" was attacked in Peter Strawson's The Bounds of Sense. This book compares logic to a courtyard in its B-preface, written six years after its A-preface. It says that we comprehend a ""manifold"" of sense-data via the ""unity of apperception,"" and claims that space and time exist as ""forms of intuition"" in our heads. Its author simplified its four sets of contradictory ""antinomies,"" and its split between phenomena and imperceptible noumena, for his Prolegomena to Any Future Metaphysics.

In The Bounds of Sense, P.F. Strawson contends that (*) ""transcendental deduction"" is this man's most important contribution. Arthur Schopenhauer included an appendix of this thinker's errors in The World as Will and Representation, but also compared reading this man's writings to ""a cataract operation on a blind person.""

For 10 points, name this author of Critique of Pure Reason.","Immanuel_Kant"
"Steven Shapin and Simon Schaffer wrote a book analyzing a scientific debate in which this philosopher denied the existence of the concept of a vacuum. He defined ""reason"" as the mathematical reckoning of the consequences of agreed-upon names, and defined ""right"" as the liberty to make use of that faculty of reason. This philosopher, who wrote a treatise attacking the experiments of Robert Boyle, used the term ""manners"" to describe actions that allow men to live in peace in unity, these actions being forms of (*) ""motion"", which he believed to be the universal cause of all things.

"This philosopher argued against the possibility of an unordered universe with the analogy of deriving a function whose graph traces over randomly drawn points.

"In a 1973 text, a philosopher argued that this theory produces the wrong ""sort of considerations...into finding the answer"" to problems posed by the examples of ""Jim and the Indians"" or ""George and the arms manufacturers."" Another objection to this theory is that it allows ""no rest."" In an adversarial collaboration with J.J.C. Smart, Bernard Williams stated that the day when people stop discussing this theory ""cannot be too far off,"" and advanced the ""integrity objection"" to it. The fact that, for a population of at least 10 billion, there could exist some larger population whose sum-total existence would be better even though individuals had lives barely worth living is a simple formulation of Derek Parfit's counterexample to this theory dubbed the ""repugnant conclusion."" For 10 points, name this ethical system under which a person facing the trolley problem should switch the track to kill one person instead of many, because that choice reduces total suffering.","Utilitarianism"
"This thinker used the equality of the three sides of a triangle as an example of a situation in which there is no connection between conceptions and judgments, but merely between sides and angles. He included two diagrams of the human eye in the fourth chapter of a book arguing that coexistence is only possible through the union of time and space. He discussed the ""subject in volition"" as the immediate object of inner sense in a book, inspired by Aristotle's explanatory doctrines, that posits ""willing,"" ""being,"" ""knowing,"" and ""becoming"" as necessary connections with the different classes of objects it identifies. He appended a critique of the transcendental analytic in Kantian philosophy to a later book in which he connected the Kantian ding-an-sich with the human will. For 10 points, name this thinker who built on his dissertation, On the Fourfold Root of the Principle of Sufficient Reason, to write The World as Will and Representation.","Arthur_Schopenhauer"

That word, ""glaube,"" was roundly derided in an 18th-century controversy about this man's thought sparked by a conversation about him between Gotthold Lessing and Friedrich Heinrich Jacobi, the latter of whom maintained that this man was a materialist. In his own time, he was castigated for pointing out that the Bible is ""imperfect, corrupt, erroneous, and inconsistent with itself,"" and fragmentary. In this man's major text on religion, he claimed that the persistence of Jews as a race was mainly due to their fastidiousness in requiring circumcision, and that the Torah should not be followed because it was only fit to serve as the state constitution of ancient Israel. This man's central religious belief was of ""Deus sive Natura,"" signifying his belief that nature and God consisted of one and the same substance. For 10 points, name this author of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus.","Baruch_Spinoza"

By showing how an infinite regress of premises, each explaining how to apply the previous ones, would be required for any argument, Quine challenged Carnap's conventionalist view of this concept. Since reference is more remote than this concept when performing radical interpretation, Davidson suggested meaning should be based on a theory of this concept instead, particularly on the Convention T of Tarski's inductively-defined semantic theory, which holds open-quote Snow is white close-quote has this property if and only if snow is white.

That people accrue credit for the virtues they display is one solution to the value problem of this concept. Stanley and Williamson have argued against a distinction between two types of this concept, which was argued for by claiming the absence of one type would require considering infinitely many propositions before taking action, and was proposed by Ryle.
