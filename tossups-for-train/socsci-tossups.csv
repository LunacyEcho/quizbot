His only major work on metaphysics was an examination of the work of Scottish philosopher Sir William Hamilton.

FTP, name this philosopher who proposed the ""harm principle"" and wrote On Liberty.","John_Stuart_Mill"
"In his later work he distinguished between value that is invoked when an interpersonal exchange occurs and value as denoting the qualitative mental evaluation of elements. Using these definitions, he created an algebra of social exchange in his Sociological Studies. In his earlier work he argued that information processing is guided by a need for equilibrium, which is restored by either assimilating new information into old patterns, or altering the old pattern to accommodate the new information.

"One critic has argued that the essay ""Embarrassment and Social Organization"" places this student of W. Lloyd Warner in the Durkheimian school of ritualistic sociology. In one of his works he concluded that marketing reflects society's paternalistic subordination of women to men. In another he elucidated a tripartite classification of social devaluation: bodily, moral, and tribal. In a more noted series of works, he developed the theory of impression management and established the metaphor of sociology as theater, for which he tends to be pigeonholed as a symbolic interactionist.

He studied acquisition of self-reinforcement behaviors through observations of models with Walter Mischel, his colleague at Stanford.  In another study by this man one type of person worked quietly with a tinker toy set, while another type of person proceeded to pick up a mallet and make comments like ""He sure is a tough fella"" and ""Punch him in the nose"" while striking a particular toy.

The founder of a laboratory dedicated to the study of defectology, he used the controversial term ""pedology"" to describe his studies in childhood education.

John Cuddihy states that there are forty-five references to the Pentatuch in his first major work, completed in 1893. In comparing the Pentateuch to the Twelve Tables, he argues that as a society gets more advanced, the individual is more pronounced and society less homogenous.

"Elements of stress present in this work include the aumaga society, called ""the strength of the village,"" and the subsequent title of matai. The female equivalent of the latter was the taupou, ceremonial virginity, which might be counterfeited with the blood of a chicken. Ridiculing this last claim, Derek Freeman, the book's chief critic, argues that its subjects were already acculturated by Christian missionaries and that presupposing a society untroubled by violence and jealousy led the author to ignore informants' evidence in favor of the cultural determinist theories of Franz Boas.

It caught on in America after playing a key role in 1933's The Human Problems of an Industrial Civilization by Elton Mayo.  In a continuation of the book that most famously employs this concept, Maurice Halbwachs rejected it.  Leo Srole developed a ""scale"" to measure it, but he was influenced by the pessimistic version introduced by Robert Merton.  In an 1893 book, it was hypothesized as an abnormal form of the division of labor, but four years later it appeared in conjugal and economic forms as a cause of suicide.

That section examines Morgan's three stage model of social evolution along a Burma-Siberia axis.  Later, this evolution is extended to the Miwok structure of oblique marriage and the Murngin practice of sister exchange, though for more complex societies positive rules for the title concept break down, and only taboos remain.

Another of his essays discusses the ""Lichtung,"" or clearing in the forest, in relation to a definition of truth as ""unconcealment"" which he takes from  Parmenides.  Yet another of his essays discusses C. F. Meyer's poem ""Roman Fountain"" and a painting of shoes by Van Gogh in order to understand the titular concept.  In addition to ""The Way to Language,"" ""The End of Philosophy and the Task of Thinking,"" and ""The Origin of the Work of Art,"" he criticized French appropriations of his thought in the ""Letter on Humanism"" and suggested that the modern world is enframed by scientific thinking in ""The Question Concerning Technology.""

Various kinds of this process were differentially impaired in Clive Wearing. The action of this process with new stimuli was studied on patient Henry (*) Molaison. The selectivity of this process is partially explained by spike-timing-dependent plasticity, which explains why long-term potentiation doesn't always occur.

"The Shimer puzzle refers to the fact that this quantity fluctuates more than theoretical predictions of the Mortensen-Pissarides [pis-sar-eedz] model. This quantity is typically placed on the x-axis of the Beveridge curve, which compares this to vacancy rates. Milton Friedman explained how this quantity could increase along with inflation, which weakened reliance on the Phillips curve. The structural form of this quantity tends to be a long-term problem, as opposed to the seasonal form which is due to some work only being available in the summer or only in the winter. Name this quantity that measures the percentage of people who do not have, but are looking for, a job.","Unemployment"
"An article sometimes called a manifesto for this school of scientists stated that they recognize no dividing line between man and brute.

"Hurwicz and Walker proposed incentive-compatible mechanisms for achieving a form of this concept proposed by Lindhal. In an infinite time horizon, assuming that utility functions have weak separability in consumption and leisure, these should be homogenous according to the Atikinson-Stiglitz theorem. That result was extended to suggest that assuming homogenous discount rates, one form of these should be zero for infinite horizons according to the Chamley-Judd theorem. A similar result by Diamond and Mirrlees showed that for flexible economies, these should always allow maintaining output along the production possibilities frontier. Constraints on maintaining utility and profits while applying these were the earliest formulation of the Ramsey problem, giving rise to the ""optimal"" analysis of these entities, which can hurt those with a high marginal propensity to consume.
