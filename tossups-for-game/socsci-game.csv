"A model of this construct involving a central executive that controls slave systems like the “phonological loop” and the “visuospatial sketchpad” was posited by Baddeley and Hitch. Their model of this construct contradicts the more simplistic multi-store model of Atkinson and Shiffrin. Elizabeth Loftus demonstrated the ability of words like “smash”​ to instill “false” versions of this capacity; she’s also known for her work with the “flashbulb” version of this capacity. As in the case of Patient H.M., lesions of the hippocampus can damage this capacity by causing both antero- and retrograde amnesia. For 10 points, name this capacity which has “long-term” and “short-term” varieties.",Memory
"One work by this thinker identified the “theodicy of fortune and misfortune” as a driving force behind different religious outlooks on economic status.

In another experiment by this psychologist, an actor was instructed to shout that he had a heart condition after being punished. For 10 points, name this psychologist who ordered subjects to administer increasingly high voltage electric shocks in his ""obedience to authority"" experiment.",Stanley_Milgram
"Indices that measure this phenomenon are commonly derived from market baskets. The increase in transaction costs due to this phenomenon drives shoe-leather costs. The federal funds rate was dramatically increased to combat this phenomenon in the Volcker shock. Real variables, unlike nominal variables, account for this phenomenon. Although the Phillips curve posited a stable inverse relationship between this phenomenon and unemployment, this phenomenon increased with stagnation during the 1970s. Zimbabwe suffered extremely high rates of this phenomenon in the early 21st century. For 10 points, name this phenomenon in which currency loses its value.",Inflation
