"Fully-functional but hard-to-use programming languages such as Whitespace or Hodor are often referred to as “tar-pits” named after this man. This non-American proved the impossibility of the Entscheidungsproblem and formalized that proof in a thesis with Alonzo Church. This man’s surname, the only proper noun to appear in the acronym “CAPTCHA”, also describes a “machine” that can model any computer algorithm using an infinitely long tape. For 10 points, give this surname of a computer scientist who devised a way to measure human-like behavior in artificial intelligences with his namesake “test”. ",Alan_Turing
"Organisms in this phylum’s orders of Alcyonacea and Scleractinia are contrasted by being described as “soft” or “stony”, the former including certain “fans” and “whips” that maintain balance through statocysts. Signs warning of a member of this phylum that can cause Irukandji syndrome can be found on many Australian beaches. This phylum includes siphonophores like the Portuguese man o’ war, which resembles other animals in this phylum’s genuses of Cubozoa and Hydrozoa. Polyps and medusas are the two main body shapes of, for 10 points, what phylum whose namesake stinging cells can be seen in corals, anemones, and jellyfish?",Cnidaria
"These functionalities can be converted into halogens using triphenylphosphine, or they can simply be displaced by a halide anion in an SN2 reaction if protonated. The presence of one of these groups defines the 3’​ ​end of a normal DNA molecule. One of these groups reacts with a carboxylic acid in the Fischer esterification. The simplest molecule containing one of these groups causes blindness if ingested instead of the second simplest form, which can cause a flushed face due to the action of this functionality’s namesake dehydrogenase. The isopropyl variety of these is used for sterilization. For 10 points, name this functionality defined by an -OH group attached to an R group.",Alcohol
"This molecule is the first one referred to in an acronym denoting a group of petrochemical compounds that also contains three isomers of xylene. Two of these molecules bonded together create a compound that used to be popular in mothballs, naphthalene. This molecule, which becomes toluene when methylated, has six pi electrons that act as a simple example of Hückel's rule. A daydream of an ouroboros inspired August Kekulé to propose an alternating single- and double-bond structure of this molecule. For 10 points, name this molecule sometimes represented as a circle inside a hexagon, the simplest aromatic compound with formula C6H6. ",Benzene
"​Synthesis of the foldase BiP is upregulated during this organelle’s stress response. SRP recognition leads to elongation arrest and translocation of complexes containing nascent polypeptides into this organelle’s membrane. Some of these organelles sequester and, upon stimulation of ryanodine receptors, release calcium ions necessary for muscle contraction. Secretory proteins are synthesized into the lumen of this organelle. This organelle is continuous with the nuclear membrane, and though not the Golgi apparatus, it consists of flattened cisternae. For 10 points, name this organelle which has a “smooth” variety and a “rough,” ribosome-studded variety.",Endoplasmic_reticulum
"​Lack of FMRP, a protein associated with intellectual disability, is caused by a methylation-inducing repeat on this structure. The RNA genes ​Jpx​ and ​Ftx​, as well as the long noncoding RNA X-IST​ ​are involved in one process involving this structure. The calico coloring of some cats results from ​lyonization of these structures into Barr bodies. A “fragile” version of this chromosome can cause developmental problems, while monosomy of it leads to Turner’s syndrome. This chromosome is “linked” with color-blindness and hemophilia. For 10 points, name this non-Y sex chromosome, two of which normally yield a “female” phenotype.",X_chromosome
"An acceleration-dependent “interpolating function” modifies the “dynamics” named for this scientist in a model proposed by Mordehai Milgrom. This scientist coined the term “centripetal force” and answered several questions posed by Edmund Halley in the tract ​De Motu.​ This scientist simplified his analysis of one problem by proving the shell theorem. Robert Hooke accused this man of plagiarizing his own work on inverse square laws. This man identified a force that attracts all bodies in proportion to their mass in his ​Principia​. For 10 points, name this English discoverer of the law of universal gravitation and three laws of motion.",Isaac_Newton
"The denominator of the probability mass function for the Poisson distribution is equal to this function of the number of occurrences. For large values, the natural log of this function of ​n​ is roughly equal to ​n​ ln ​n​ – ​n​, according to an approximation named for Stirling. The sum of this function’s reciprocal over the natural numbers converges to Euler’s constant. This function is extended to complex numbers by the gamma function. The number of ways to order ​n​ distinct objects is equal to this function of ​n​. For 10 points, name this function whose​ nt​h value is equal to the product of all natural numbers up to ​n​, which is denoted by an exclamation point.",Factorial
"The effect of entrainment velocity on this force is depicted in the Stribeck curve. Sixty-four over the Reynolds number gives a factor named for Darcy and this force. For a stationary block on an inclined plane, this force’s magnitude equals the product of g, the mass of the block, and the cosine of the angle of incline. The​ arctangent of the angle of repose is equal to a value related to this force. This force can be reduced by ball bearings and comes in “kinetic” and “static” forms. For 10 points, name this force between two contacting bodies that opposes motion.",Friction
